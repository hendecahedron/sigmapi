    Protocols

    There are 2 types of node in a factor graph: Variable and Factor

    There are several algorithms that can be run on a factor graph,
    each of which involves different kinds of messages being exchanged.

    Each node must have product (x) and identity (i) functions

    As in the single-i algorithm, message passing is initiated at
    the leaves. Each vertex v remains idle until messages have arrived
    on all but one of the edges incident on v. Just as in the
    single-i algorithm, once these messages have arrived, v is able
    to compute a message to be sent on the one remaining edge
    to its neighbor (temporarily regarded as the parent), just as in
    the single-i algorithm, i.e. according to Fig. 5. Let us denote
    this temporary parent as vertex w. After sending a message to w
    , vertex v returns to the idle state, waiting for a “return message”
    to arrive from w. Once this message has arrived, the vertex
    is able to compute and send messages to each of its neighbors
    (other than w), each being regarded, in turn, as a parent.


    Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning page 412

    We can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured
    factor graphs by substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor
    graph expansion into (8.89) and again exchanging maximizations with products.
    The structure of this calculation is identical to that of the
    sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those
    results into the present context.
    In particular, suppose that we designate a particular
    variable node as the ‘root’ of the graph.
    Then we start a set of messages propagating inwards from the leaves
    of the tree towards the root, with each node sending its message
    towards the root once it has received all incoming messages from its other neighbours.
    The final maximization is performed over the product
    of all messages arriving at the root node,
    and gives the maximum value for p(x).
    This could be called the max-product algorithm and is
    identical to the sum-product algorithm except that summations
    are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage,
    messages have been sent from leaves to the root,
    but not in the other direction.

    (somewhere in one paper it says that any node can be root,
    actually one node will emerge as root somewhere naturally but
    if it's a factor node it needs to pass and allow a variable
    node to be the root)

(defn message-passing
  "

    Synchronous message-passing on the given model given previous-model.
    This is the simplest form of message-passing. Can add other
    kinds (loopy, asynchronous core.async) later but this is easy to test

    Returns the given model with its messages updated

    A model is a map with:

    * a graph describing its structure
    * a messages map of the form {:node-to-id {:node-from-id message}}
    * a map of nodes (variable, factor)

    Messaging has two phases: in from the leaves >< and out
    from the root <>. The root is the variable node that messages
    from the leaves happen to converge on (if a factor node
    happens to get the chance to become root it passes).
    Each node combines its messages according to its local
    product and sum functions and sends the result to the node
    it's summarizing for
    (or all but one of its neighbours if it's root - see comment above).
